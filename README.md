wikiguess
=========

Wikiguess is a fun Wikipedia-based game made by Saloni Shah, Jin Park, and Karthik Shanmugam at a UC Berkeley Hackathon.

The player gets a word bank and keyword clues which are random, descriptive words from a Wikipedia article. For each keyword, the player should guess what article from the word bank the keywords corresponds to. The goal is to get it right with fewer clues and guesses each time. Difficulty level can be tweaked.
